# R_final_project
Team Project - The project involves analyzing data about basketball players from the NBA League in the 2015-2016 season. 
The motivating question of the analysis is: “In the 2015-2016 season, how do the skills of a player relate to his salary?” We argue that regardless of their positions, most players earn a salary which is directly correlated with their skill levels.

## Synopsis ##

This project focuses on analyzing data about basketball players from the
National Basketball Association (NBA) League in the 2015-2016 season. The
central topic behind this project has to do with the salary and performance of
NBA players. To be more precise, the motivating question is: “In the 2015-2016
season, how do the skills of a player relate to his salary?” We argue that
regardless of their positions, most players earn a salary which is directly
correlated with their skill levels. See reports/report.Rmd for a full analysis.

## Shiny Apps ##
